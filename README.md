# Churnpredictionproject
This is a machine learning churn prediction system that predicts customers who are likely to churn and possible retention initiatives


1.	PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers churn i.e. discontinue their subscription or service.

KEY STEPS IN THE PROJECT
•	DATA SOURCES: The data set used in this project was provided by 10alytics, gathered specifically for this project.
•	DATA PREPROCESSING: The data set was verified and missing data was identified and handled.
•	EDA: Relationship between variables was visualized, the structure, patterns and anomalies was understood and detected through the visualization. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis was all performed.
•	MACHINE LEARNING MODEL: The customer churn prediction was built using a supervised machine model, models was trained and tested with several classifiers like logistic regression, random forest, kneighbor classifier after extensive experimentation and hyperparameters tuning, the final machine learning model was selected based on its performance and generalization capabilities.
•	EVALUATION OF THE MODELS: To evaluate the models the following evaluation metrics was used.
	Accuracy score
	Precision score
	Fi score 

•	MODEL SELECTION AND IMPROVEMENT: This is to identify the model most relevant for predicting churn through the future important techniques. This technique shows how improvement can be can be done to avoid customer churn and improve retention in the company.

CONCLUSION: Customer churn prediction is a valuable test for maintaining a stable and loyal customer base which was what the machine learning models accurately identified, prevented to retain and sustain customers.
